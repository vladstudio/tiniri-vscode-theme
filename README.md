### Why Tiniri

- Most themes tend to use as many colors as possible for syntax highlighting. I might be sensitive, but it distracts me more than helps. I wanted a theme that uses no more than two or three colors.

- Most themes tend to be neutral or cold. I wanted a theme that's slightly (but not overly) warm.

- Most themes use saturated colors (same as using "loud" voice when speaking). I wanted a theme with high contrast but low saturation, "quieter" colors.

- Most themes are modern, cool or expressive. I wanted a slightly retro theme, as if you're sitting in an old cozy sofa reading an old-fashioned book.

### Also

I found these fonts to play especially nice with Tiniri:

- [SF Mono](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/)
- [IBM Plex Mono](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)

If you use Git Graph, add to your `settings.json`:
